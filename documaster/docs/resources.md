## About Resources

Use the Protocol API to access contacts, conversations, group
messages, and more and seamlessly integrate your product into the
workflows of dozens of devoted Protocol users.

### Getting started

To get started, create a new application in your
[developer settings](/dev-settings), then read about how to make
requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs
or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go
live, publish it to our [integrations directory](/integrations-directory) to
reach the Protocol community.
